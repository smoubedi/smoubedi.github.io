            The project is a robotic car with a grabbing arm designed to be capable of picking up light objects such as empty tin cans, water bottles, or a ball.

            <br><br>
            The car is driven by a separate control unit connected via cable for the motion and arm control. One controller manages the individual tires' direction and speed of rotation while the second controller manages the arm height as well as the grip diameter of the arm.  
            <br><br>
            The controller inputs were all fed into a PIC-AXE 20M microcontroller which then fed the output into four distinct servo motors running off a 5V supply.
