            To be officially released in late 2014, Rate My Sublet is a social reviewing web application aimed to take the hassle out of subletting and leasing homes. The aim is simple: to provide students with quick access to the info they need about the places they plan to spend the next grueling four months in. 
            <br>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            Students who have leased or subleased a home for their school semester, can now make formal reviews on the room they stayed in. The review information consists of the cost of the room, the maintenance, roominess, location, and the presence/absence of utilities, internet, and furniture. The site is designed around anonymity such that anyone can post a review and never have to once click the "sign up" button or worry about their identity being released.

            <br><br>


            Initially on load, the home page appears and centers around the University of Waterloo and the Wilfred Laurier University. The application revolves around a current "focused" location. If the focused location is an area, it will show all the reviewed houses in that area and order them through popularity:

            <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/Projects/RATE_MY_SUBLET/Images/popularPage.png"><img src="/Projects/RATE_MY_SUBLET/Images/popularPage.png"></a>
            <br><br>


            If the user searches up a house address on the other hand, the application view will display quick information for the house, and will allow the user to review if they have not done so already:
            <br><br>
            <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="/Projects/RATE_MY_SUBLET/Images/mainPage.png"><img src="/Projects/RATE_MY_SUBLET/Images/mainPage.png"></a>
            <br><br>


            If the user clicks on the "More Info" button, they will be presented with a page displaying all the owner reviews for the house. These reviews can be upvoted and downvoted which also constitutes as flagging the review. An intractable Street View of the house will be presented on the top of the page for users to get a quick feel for what the house looks like on the outside. The "Travel Time" section presents users with the time it would take to either walk, bike, bus, or drive to the University of their Choice. The "Classifieds" section will search through Kijiji, CraigsList, Google, and Official Sites to find any current leasing opportunities.

            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            The site uses a wide variety of technologies to keep running.
            <br>
            <b>On the front end,</b> the site runs off of the AngularJS framework and utilizes the jQuery libraries. Much of the functionality of the front end is provided through the Google API's, including the Google Maps V3 API, Google Geocoder Service, Google Directions Service, Google Panorama Service, Google Autocomplete Service, and Google Custom Search API.
            <br>
            <b>On the back end,</b> the site is hosted with Heroku and stores data on a MongoDB database. The backend services are ran with Node.js and mongoose. The application also integrates the Temporize scheduler for automated statistical data mining, Bomberman for profanity filtering, and MongoLab for backing up the database.
