            The DC Power Supply is a variable supply built from a regular scrap PC ATX Power Supply Unit. It has an output port for supplying VGA devices, and a variable output which reaches 1.2V to 10.2V.

            The circuit design incorporates an amplifier with a variable band pass filter. At its tightest settings, the circuit will only respond to audio frequencies from 7Hz to 200Hz. This ensures that the lights only blink to the bass of the music which is essentially its tempo. At its loosest setting, the highest passing frequence it accepts is ~17 kHz which is around the limit of the human ear. This range is useful for listening to treble heavy music such as classical or vocals.

            The high pass filter as well as a full wave rectifier and capacitors are used to remove the very low frequencies less than 7 Hz. These frequencies will simply cause the LED's to blink which is unfavourable.

            The power supply is a regulated 12 volt power adapter rated for 5 Watts which is then split to +/- 6V, and the input can use various audio channels. The circuit has  3 modes of operation: Off, Sound Reactive, Constant On.
