            The DC Power Supply is a variable supply built from a regular scrap PC ATX Power Supply Unit. It has an output port for supplying VGA devices, and a variable output which reaches 1.2V to 10.2V.

            The voltage regulation is done via three LM 317T linear regulators, two of which are set permanetly to 3.3V and 5V used for digital logic, and one with a potentiometer for varying output. Although the individual regulator is rated to source up to 1.5A of current, it is an extremely inefficient DC to DC conversion method and will generate a lot of heat given the right circumstances. There is barely any heat dissipation used in this design so 1.5A is simply impractical.

            The voltage on the variable rail is also displayed via a panel mounted seven segment display. The displays are controlled through a PIC 20X microcontroller flashed with firmware found on the public domain. Finally, it is important to note that in order for the PSU to start-up, there must be a constant load recognized by the internal circuitry, so a dummy load must always be present.
