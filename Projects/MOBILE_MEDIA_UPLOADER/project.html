            The mobile media uploader is a web-based multiplatform mobile application designed to allow any employee, at any time and place in the world, to take a picture, video, or file and send it back to the company sharepoint servers for further handling. The main priority was intended to aid the QA and Procurement teams with product management and supply, however the application itself is very versatile and can be put to use in a multitude of scenarios.

            Initially on load, the page is very minimal asking only for a file to upload. In the background however, it is busy fetching the user data, phone info, geolocation, custom view, and connection type.

            <br><br>
            Once the file has been selected (an image in this case), the application creates a unique ID for the file, and attempts to display the file using built in HTML5 components. It then uses the custom selected view specified in the server to generate required file metadata fields for the user the fill out. 
            <br>
            Once the upload button has been hit, the file will be sent back to the servers asynchronously with the data, the geolocation and the closest office to the user, as well as any user inputted metadata.

            <br><br>Finally, the image can be viewed in the specified sharepoint image library.
