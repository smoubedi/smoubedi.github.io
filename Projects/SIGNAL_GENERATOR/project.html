            This signal generator utilizes mixed digital/analog hardware design to create sinusoidal, triangle, and square waves up to 5MHz. The analog output also supports amplitude tuning up to 6V peak to peak, phase tuning, and DC offsets from -3V to 3V. These parameters can all be changed either manually on the board through switches and potentiometers or digitally through an ethernet connection. By connecting the device to a computer, it will host a web application on the local area network which can be accessed using any regular web browser.

            I am currently doing some final adjustments and working on board bring-up. The latest schematics, board files, and firmware are available here:

            Researching techniques to generate the sinusoidal waveforms was one of my many tasks during my internship on the Apple Watch team, so I took this knowledge and incorporated into making a full-system signal generator. The two primary options I was considering were to use a pseudo-analog wein-bridge oscillator or a fully digital approach with analog filtering. A wien-bridge oscillator would have defenitly provided less harmonic distortion, would have simplified the overall design and BOM cost, but it would also have been a pain to tune and debug. Furthermore, amplitude stability poses a difficult challenge in that solution and a 5MHz bandwidth would be impractical without using multiple, tunable feedback paths. The final solution utilizes a DDS (direct digital synthesis) IC, which is essentially a DAC reading a built-in sine wave ROM. As a result this circuit also needs a good reconstruction filter to remove any high-frequency components generated by the DAC. This solution also gave me better control over the frequency, phase, and also supports triangle wave outputs as a nice bonus.

            The voltage regulation is done via three LM 317T voltage regulator packages, two of which are set permanetly to 3.3V and 5V and used for VGA power, and one with a potentiometer for varying output.
