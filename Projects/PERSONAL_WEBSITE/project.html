            Chances are that by the time you are reading this, you have already seen the bulk of what www.shaheen.moubed.uni.me has to offer. My personal portfolio website, designed and developed by yours truely, is meant to showcase my completed and ongoing public projects, and to try and speak for who I am and what I strive for as a human being.

            The site was developed using a single-page dynamically loading web-design. As a result, the majority of the website can be navigated solely by the use of one's keyboard. The left/right keys will navigate you through each navigational page and project page, while the backspace/escape key will help direct you back to the respective parent page.
            <br><br>
            The website is slightly script heavy, and is proud to announce that it runs on javascript and the jQuery library exclusively, without the use of any additional frameworks. On top of that, the site is fully device responsive up to a minimum screen width of 400 pixels.
