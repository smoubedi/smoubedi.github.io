                    Im a current Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and have a passion for pretty much everything that shocks, jolts, and lights up. I have been a "hands-on fanatic" ever since I got my first PC and voltmeter and have used this mentality to carry me through various personal projects. <br><br>
                    I hope that you enjoy your short visit, and I hope that this site will speak for who I am as a person and what I strive for in life. <br><br>
