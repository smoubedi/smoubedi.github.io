            Hello! For those of you who don't know me, I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and have a passion for pretty much anything and everything that shocks, jolts, and lights up. As a self-proclaimed "hands-on fanatic", I have been tinckering with electronics and computers pretty much since I got my first pc and voltmeter, be it collecting computer parts to taking apart broken appliances to even making small gadgets of my own. Getting my fingers dirty this way has always been my greatest hobby, and you can see some of the work those fingers accomplished in my portfolio pages.
