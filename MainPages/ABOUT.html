            Hello! For those of you who don't know me, I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and I have a passion for pretty much anything and everything that shocks, jolts, and lights up. As a self-proclaimed "hands-on fanatic," I have been tinkering with electronics and computers all my life. To sum things up, my multimeter is my right-hand man.
            <br>
            <br>Getting my fingers dirty this way has always been my greatest hobby, and you can see some of my accomplishments in my portfolio pages. To know a bit more about me or what I do, head over to my <a href="../resume-ShaheenMoubedi.pdf">resume</a>, or send me an <a href="mailto:smoubedi@uwaterloo.ca?body=Hello Shaheen, ">email</a> or <a href="skype:shaheenster?chat">skype</a> invitation.
            <br>
            <br>Yours truly,
            <br>Shaheen Moubedi
