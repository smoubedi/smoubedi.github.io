            Hello! For those of you who don't know me, I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and have a passion for pretty much anything and everything that shocks, jolts, and lights up. As a self-proclaimed "hands-on fanatic," I have been tinkering with electronics and computers all my life. Since I received my first PC and voltmeter, I've enjoyed collecting computer parts, taking apart broken appliances, and making small gadgets of my own. Getting my fingers dirty this way has always been my greatest hobby, and you can see some of my accomplishments in my portfolio pages.
            <br>
            <br>I hope that you enjoy your visit, and that my site speaks for who I am and what I strive for as an electrical engineer. To know a bit more about me or what I do, head over to my <a href="../resume-ShaheenMoubedi.pdf">resume</a>, or send me an <a href="mailto:smoubedi@uwaterloo.ca?body=Hello Shaheen, ">email</a> or <a href="skype:shaheenster?chat">skype</a> invitation.
            <br>
            <br>Yours truly,
            <br>Shaheen Moubedi
